   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Follow Dart/Flutter conventions**: Use `dart format` to format your code
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Comments**: Write clear comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- **File organization**: Keep related code together and maintain clean imports

### Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep models, services, and UI components separate
- **State Management**: Use Provider for reactive state management
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications, especially for web deployment

### Code Quality Checklist

Before submitting your contribution:
- [ ] Code follows Dart/Flutter style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass: `flutter test`
- [ ] Code analysis passes: `flutter analyze`
- [ ] No new lint warnings or errors
- [ ] Web build works: `flutter build web`
- [ ] Manual testing completed on target platforms

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test business logic in services and utilities
- **Widget Tests**: Test UI components and user interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows

Example test structure:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:material_theme_builder/services/theme_generator_service.dart';

void main() {
  group('ThemeGeneratorService', () {
    test('should generate valid color scheme from seeds', () {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
}
```
